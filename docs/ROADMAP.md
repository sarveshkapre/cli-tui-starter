# ROADMAP

## Now
- Solid TUI starter with themes, key bindings, accessibility toggles, config-driven demo defaults, optional mouse support, and a non-interactive `demo --no-tty` preview.
- Demo showcases a couple of common widget patterns (gauge + table) while staying minimal.

## Next
- Expand the demo to showcase more widgets/layouts (forms, scrolling lists, etc.) without growing the codebase too much.
- Add a light recording/debug mode for reproducible TUI interaction traces.
