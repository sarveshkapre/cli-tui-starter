# ROADMAP

## Now
- Solid TUI starter with themes, key bindings, accessibility toggles, config-driven demo defaults, and a non-interactive `demo --no-tty` preview.
- Demo showcases a couple of common widget patterns (gauge + table) while staying minimal.

## Next
- Expand the demo to showcase more widgets/layouts (tabs, forms, scrolling lists) without growing the codebase too much.
- Optional mouse input with explicit opt-in.
